# **App Name**: InfoSleuth

## Core Features:

- Internet Scan: Number Scan: Scans the internet for publicly available information about a given phone number, including websites, documents (PDFs, spreadsheets, etc.) that mention the number. The LLM will reason when deciding what results contain valuable and verified information versus superficial mentions or potential scams. This AI tool ensures only credible, relevant data is presented.
- Document Summary: Content Summarization: Employs an LLM tool to read and summarize textual content found within relevant documents (e.g., PDFs, webpages).
- Report Display: Consolidated Report: Displays all gathered information, summaries, and links to sources in a clear and structured report. The report is shown in a well formatted manner, and is easy to navigate.
- Number Input: Number Input: Accepts a phone number as input from the user, allowing them to initiate the information-gathering process. A friendly message guides the user as they type. Numbers will conform to a valid North American phone number, including area code. Error messaging helps guide the user as they type, and does not let them submit invalid information.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#5885AF), reflecting information gathering and reliability without feeling too corporate.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F2F5), providing a neutral backdrop to maintain focus on content.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#8A6899), used for highlights and interactive elements to suggest insights and precision.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Recommended to pair with Space Grotesk for a modern and highly legible text.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons for data types (e.g., web links, documents) and actions (e.g., summarize, view source).
- Employ a clear, card-based layout to present information in digestible chunks. Use whitespace generously to avoid overwhelming the user.
